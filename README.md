# FlashCards!

## Welcome to Flash Cards. The fastest game in the West!

### Description

Flashcards is a terminal based app that has a deck of 30 cards, each with a question, collection of answers, and a correct answer. The user navigates through the terminal answering questions, and is shown the percentage of correct answers once all cards have been asked. This focus of this project is to work with classes and objects, manipulate the data and have the object classes interact with each other. This project also focuses heavily on testing, using the Mocha testing framework and the chai assertion library. 

### How to begin:

In the terminal, run the following command:

### Setup!
Clone down repo (from this GitHub). Since you don't want to name the game "flashcards-starter", you can use an optional argument when you run git clone (you replace the [...] with the terminal command arguments):

`bash
git clone [remote-address] [what you want to name the repo]`

Once you have cloned the repo, change into the directory:<br><br>
`bash
cd [whatever you named the directory]`

Running node index.js from the root of the directory to start the game:<br><br>
`bash
node index.js`
